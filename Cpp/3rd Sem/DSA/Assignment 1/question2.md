# Three Real-Life Applications of Circular Linked List


1.	Music or Video Playlists

-	Media players often use circular linked lists to cycle through songs or videos.
-	After the last track finishes, the playlist loops back to the first automatically.

2.	Round Robin CPU Scheduling

-	Operating systems use circular linked lists in round robin scheduling.

- Each process is stored in a node, and the scheduler cycles through them continuously, giving each process equal CPU time.

3.	Multiplayer Board/Card Games

-	Playersâ€™ turns are managed in a circular fashion.

-	After the last player completes a turn, control goes back to the first player seamlessly


## Why Circular is More Useful than Simple Linked List?
- In a simple linked list, traversal stops at the last node (NULL). To restart, you must traverse from the head again.

- In a circular linked list, the last node points back to the first.

- This allows continuous traversal without restarting.

- It eliminates the need for NULL checks.

- Makes it ideal for repetitive, cyclic tasks like scheduling, looping playlists, or round-robin games.
