/*
Write a C++ program that defines a class "Employee" with attributes for name, employeeID, and salary. 
Implement a parameterized constructor to initialize these attributes when an object is created 
and a destructor that displays a message when an object is destroyed. 
Additionally, include a displayInfo() function to print the employeeâ€™s details. 
Inside the main() function, create multiple objects to observe the constructor and destructor execution sequence.
